First Assignment ICS3U-02 2018-19

Assignment Structure for Programs
Your comments at the top of your work/flow chart or program, should contain the following:
The Unit (example Unit 1), the Assignment number (example Assignment 1) and the Question number. 
Your Name and date you began creation/coding the question.  (at the top for coding, wherever clear on flowcharts)
Modifications you made, dated (for coding - last pieces at the top before the program begins.)
The question or problem you were asked to solve/produce/create - at the top for coding.
A MUST, all work, flowcharts, the Code pieces you borrowed, and ideas must be properly acknowledged (Comments in your code, footnotes on other pieces).  You need to state, from where you borrowed, book/page/teacher/class notes with date/friend etc. and the link (You are encouraged to borrow “good” code and acknowledge the author/creator/writer).  We borrow code all the time in the field, and we acknowledge the author.  Failure to properly acknowledge what is borrowed is plagiarism and earns a zero on the entire question.
White space to make all of this easy to read
 Any notes or cautions about quirky things or test data.
 
Almost every line of code should have a comment. You can block comment. {You may use a comment for 2 or 3 rows, like “ setting up variables and constants with zero’s to eliminate infinite loops”.
 
IMPORTANT - Program Naming: Please name your Assignment programs/folders by FirstNameLastInitial, followed by U for Unit and number followed by Questions and number (IE: MohammedAU1Q1.py  or MsHarrisU1Q1.pdf for flowchart). The folder containing everything, does not have questions numbers.   For example; Mohammed’s version of Question 4 on Unit 2 would be would be MohammedAU2Q4. 
 
Note:  If your first name, last initial is not unique, you will need another initial on your last name until you are uniquely identified. (ie: Mohammed, Dan, Kevin, Adam, Sean etc.) {NOTE: Add last initials until your name is unique – past example, AlexC, AlexKa and AlexKr.)
 
Your Assignment needs to handed in twice (txt files for all Python files (for Code) and pdf or jpg for flowcharts into Google Classroom) and uploaded (not Linked) – please ask if you have never uploaded a file or compressed a group of files.  Remember to click the “Turn In” twice or I don’t have it for marking and verification.  The second hand in, is not really a hand-in, it’s your work on GitHub.  I will be uploading improvements and rubrics to your GitHub School account.
   
The generic rubric applies to each question, but the weighting will change slightly for each question. (We may make minor modifications to the rubic tomorrow in class - make sure you have the most recent version.) 

One last note:  Any images or photo’s must be your originals or Common License and acknowledged.  (No Plagiarized images.)
  
(Basic Programming) - Create a flowchart, then write a program to perform a unit conversion of your own choosing.  Make sure that the program prints an introduction that explains what it does.
NOTE: Class examples and examples from the homework readings are not allowed, this should be your original conversion, not something borrowed.


2)   Make a flowchart, then write a program that finds the average of a series of numbers entered by the user.  The program will ask the user how many numbers are being entered.  Note: The average should always be a float, even if the user inputs are all ints.
 
4)   Please create a flowchart, and 2 or more functions, to create something impressive with turtle. Use turtle and randomly produce something small on an appropriate background. (School GP please).  Similar, but totally different from the star and flower example your teacher showed you in class and different from the “Spiral graph” like examples in the readings too.
	  (You may use the random function your teacher used for the star.)


 
5)   WOW me with your CSV Input/Output knowledge.  Create a flowchart and then write a program that uses any valid csv file you have pulled.  Good sources are from a reliable source (Stats Can, a Univ weather site etc.)  Make sure you document where your CSV file is from.

a. Your csv file must have a minimum of 4 columns and
b. A minimum of 10 rows
c. You must write out summary data as applicable.  Examples of the functions you may use are; 
                                         i.	Average (no function, but this is just a “Sum” (a built in function) divided by your row data.
                                        ii.	Min (it’s a function)  see Example at https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python3/list_min.htm
                                       iii.	Max (it’s a function)  https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python3/list_max.htm
                                       iv.	Sub totals for a particular subcategory (ie: province vs Canada, time of year Fall vs. Spring.  This  really does depend upon your data and topic.)
d.  Your output should be to both screen and csv file.  Make the output to screen look nice.                  
Have fun with this one!
